# Awakure – A Smarter, Hard‑to‑Ignore Morning Alarm  

![Awakure Logo](assets/icons/awakure_icon.png)

## 🚀 Motivation & Problem Statement

> **“Why is it so easy to hit snooze—day after day—when the world needs us to wake up on time?”**

For years, I—and my family—struggled with the **snooze trap**. No matter how early we set our alarms, we’d drift back to sleep rather than start our day. Yet, when there’s a truly “big event” (a flight, an exam, meeting someone important), we spring awake without a second thought.  

I discovered that two forces wake us reliably:
1. **Immediate mental engagement** (a puzzle, a challenge)  
2. **Intrinsic motivation** (something we truly care about)

**Awakure** combines both by:
- Pushing your brain to solve a quick problem (math, pattern, or custom “wake‑task”)  
- Announcing your day’s **to‑do list** via Text‑to‑Speech  

This leverages **cognitive arousal** and **purpose‑driven motivation** to break the snooze habit.

## 🧠 Psychology of Waking Up

1. **Cognitive Activation**: Simple math or pattern recognition wakes prefrontal cortex, halting the sleep inertia loop.  
2. **Purpose Anchoring**: Hearing your own tasks reminds you of real‑world stakes.  
3. **Habit Disruption**: By removing the autopilot of snooze, you build a new ritual of waking with intention.

## 🛠️ Build & Run

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Qt6** via **vcpkg**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
   cd vcpkg
   .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
   .\vcpkg integrate install
   .\vcpkg install qt6:x64-windows
````

2. **Clone this repo** and create a build folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/awakure.git
   cd awakure
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```
3. **Configure & build**:

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   cmake --build .
   ```

### Run

```bash
./awakure.exe
```

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Alarm Tab**:

   * Tap “Add Alarm” → pick time + label + repeat.
   * Alarms saved in JSON and listed with enable toggles.

2. **To‑Do Tab**:

   * Tap “Add Task” → enter your morning to‑dos.
   * Tasks stored persistently.

3. **Morning Routine**:

   * At the first active alarm of the day, `QTextToSpeech` reads out your tasks.
   * To dismiss the alarm, solve a simple math puzzle—activating your brain instantly.

---

## 🚀 Extensions & Roadmap

* **Recurring schedules**: Weekly rhythms, custom date ranges
* **Smart analytics**: Track wake‑up success rate, habit streaks
* **Mobile ports**: Android/iOS via Qt Mobile or Flutter bridge
* **Voice recognition**: Say “stop” to dismiss (using speech‑to‑text)
